 * limits.h — Generous, env-configurable safety limits (Stage 2 / Track B4).

 * Each knob has a generous default. Hitting a limit degrades to a *reported*
 * skip (surfaced via MCP/CLI/logfile), never a silent drop and never an
 * unbounded read (unbounded just trades a crash for an OOM/hang). Every limit
 * is env-overridable so an operator can tune it per-repo without a rebuild.
